# Segmentation

Download the Segment Anything 1B dataset [here](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/segment-anything-downloads/).

Note that the indices from the SA-1B dataset are _almost_ continuous but not quite.
The files `sa_000000/sa_2088.png` and `sa_000000/sa_2088.json` were missing, I just copied over image and annotation 2087 to "fix" it.
